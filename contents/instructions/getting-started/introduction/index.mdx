# Welcome to the Mayfest Productions Learning App!

Welcome to the Mayfest Productions Technology Team! We’re excited to have you on board and help you kickstart your journey with our tech stack. This project has been designed to introduce you to the core technologies we use to build scalable, modern, and professional web applications. As you work through this learning app, you'll get hands-on experience with the key tools we use, including:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM
- Supabase
- Tailwind CSS

This guide will walk you through how to get everything set up, from cloning the project to running it locally on your machine. We’ve left out some parts of the code intentionally, so you can fill them in as part of your learning process. Don’t worry if things seem a bit tricky at first—that’s what this guide is here for. You'll be guided step by step!

Ready to dive in? Let’s get started with setting up your environment and cloning the project!

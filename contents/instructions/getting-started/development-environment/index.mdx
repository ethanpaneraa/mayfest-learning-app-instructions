# Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you start working on the Mayfest Productions Learning App, you'll need to set up your local development environment. Follow these steps to get everything installed and running on your machine:

## 0. Getting your dependencies setup

You need to have the following installed locally on your machine:

### Install Node.js & npm

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are essential for JavaScript development, enabling you to install libraries, frameworks, and run your app locally.

1. **Download Node.js**:

   - Visit [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the LTS version.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   ^^ These commands should give you a number back, otherwise, your installation didn't work

### Install Git

Git is a version control system used to track changes in your code and collaborate with others.

1. **Download Git**:

   - Visit [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install the appropriate version for your OS.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   git --version:
   ```

This should display the currently installed Git version on your machine.

3. Configure Git (use your github credentials/account info!!)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

If you issues with git and personal access tokens, look at [the documentation as a resource](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

### Install an IDE

You can whatever you prefer, but I reccomend that everyone uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's free and basically anyone that does modern web dev uses it.

## 1. Fork the repository

The first step is to fork the learning app into your Github account. This is because since there will be many of working on this app, you have your own "workspace" to work on the project on your own.

To do this, you will go to [repository](https://github.com/mayfest/mayfest-learning-app-empty) and press the button `fork` on the top right of the screen (it's above the green `code` button).

Give Github some time to fork the repo into your account. Once the fork has finished, move onto the next step.

## 2. Cloning the project into a directory

Next, you will clone your fork somewhere onto your machine. To do this, you will need to open a new terminal **and** cd into a directory where you want to store and run this project (anywhere is fine but it's best practice to do this somewhere where you can easily come back to it)

An example (I'm on macos)

```bash
cd desktop
cd Mayfest-Productions
```

Then, you wil go to back to Github, press on the green `code` button again and under the `HTTPS` header, there should be a link, copy it.

Go back to your terminal and now do the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayfest/mayfest-learning-app.git
```

**your url should look different than mine!!**

Finally, you will cd into the project now

```bash
cd mayfest-learning-app
```

## 3. Installing Packages

Next, you will need to install the necessary packages to run the project locally.

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Setting up Environment Variables

After installing the packages, you'll need to set up your environment variables. These are crucial for the app to function properly.

1. **Open VSCode**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

This command opens VSCode in your current directory. If this doesn't work, you can manually open VSCode and use File → Open Folder to navigate to your project.

2. **Create Environment File**:

   - In VSCode, right-click in the file explorer (left sidebar)
   - Select "New File"
   - Name it exactly `.env`

3. **Add Environment Variables**:

   - Copy and paste the following into your `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   # Drizzle
   DATABASE_URL= # get this from supabase

   # Next Auth
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET= # this can be whatever

   # Next Auth Spotify Provider
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID= # get this from the spotify developer dashboard
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET= # get tihis also from the spotify developer dashboard
   ```

4. **Save the File**:

   - Press `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + S` (Mac) to save
   - Or go to File → Save

5. **Important Notes**:
   - Never commit the `.env` file to GitHub
   - The `.env` file should already be in your `.gitignore`
   - If you need to share these variables with team members, use a secure method

## 5. Running the Project Locally

Now you can continue with running the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your project should now run with all the necessary environment variables configured!

This will compile and setup a port for the project to run. You can go the URL that the terminal prints out and see the project in your browser!

If you got this far, congrats!! You made it through the first part!!

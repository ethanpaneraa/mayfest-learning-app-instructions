# Setting Up Required Accounts

Before continuing with the development setup, you'll need to create accounts with several services. Follow these steps to get everything set up:

## GitHub Account Setup

GitHub is where we'll host our code and collaborate with other developers.

1. **Create a GitHub Account**:

   - Visit [GitHub's signup page](https://github.com/signup)
   - Enter your email address
   - Create a strong password
   - Choose a unique username
   - Verify your email address when prompted

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Security
   - Follow the prompts to set up 2FA
   - Store your recovery codes in a safe place

## Spotify Developer Account

You'll need a Spotify Developer account to access their API.

1. **Create a Spotify Account**:

   - If you don't already have one, create a [Spotify account](https://www.spotify.com/signup)
   - Free accounts work fine for development

2. **Access Developer Dashboard**:

   - Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Log in with your Spotify credentials
   - Accept the Developer Terms of Service

3. **Create Your First App**:
   - Click "Create App" in the dashboard
   - Fill in the required information:
     - App name (this can be anything)
     - App description (this can be anything)
     - Redirect URI (use `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify` for development) - this is given to you, this is a pain to setup
   - Save your Client ID and Client Secret somewhere secure

## Supabase Account Setup

Supabase will serve as our database and backend service.

1. **Create a Supabase Account**:

   - Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
   - Click "Start your project"
   - Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email

2. **Create Your First Project**:

   - Click "New Project" in the dashboard
   - Choose a name for your project (i.e Mayfest-Learning-App)
   - Set a secure database password
   - Choose the region closest to you (Ohio)
   - Select the free tier

3. **Save Important Credentials**:
   - After project creation, save your:
     - Project URL
     - anon/public key
     - service_role key (keep this secret!)

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys, secrets, or credentials to GitHub
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- If you accidentally expose any credentials, immediately rotate them in the respective dashboards

## Next Steps

Once you have all these accounts set up, you can continue with the project setup. Make sure to keep all your credentials in a secure place - you'll need them when we configure the application's environment variables.

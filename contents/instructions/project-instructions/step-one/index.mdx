title: Task 1 - Building the Landing Page
description: Step-by-step guide to implementing the Spotify Stats landing page
---

Let's build the landing page for our Spotify Stats application! This guide will walk you through creating a responsive, animated landing page using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## What We're Building

- A modern landing page with animated sections
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Authentication-aware UI that changes based on user login state
- Three main sections: Hero, Features, and Call-to-Action

## Setup

1. Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b task/landing-page
```

2. Navigate to the following directory (or open using the VSCode File Tree Viewer):

```bash
cd src
cd components
```

You'll notice that AnimatedHomePage.tsx is empty! That is what you're implementing

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Basic Component Setup

First, let's set up our imports and basic component structure:

```typescript
"use client";

import Link from "next/link";
import { type Session } from "next-auth";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Music, BarChart2, Clock } from "lucide-react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

interface AnimatedHomePageProps {
  session: Session | null;
}

export default function AnimatedHomePage({ session }: AnimatedHomePageProps) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
      {/* We'll add our sections here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Adding the Hero Section

The hero section includes an animated gradient background and main content:

1. Add the background gradient:

```tsx
<motion.div
  className="absolute inset-0 -z-10 overflow-hidden"
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 1 }}
>
  {/* Add the SVG gradient here */}
</motion.div>
```

2. Add the main content section:

```tsx
<section className="relative w-full overflow-hidden rounded-xl bg-gradient-to-b from-green-50 via-blue-50 to-white py-12 md:py-24 lg:py-32 xl:py-48">
  {/* Add the title, description, and button here */}
</section>
```

### 3. Creating the Features Section

Create a reusable `FeatureCard` component and implement the features section:

```tsx
function FeatureCard({ icon, title, description }: FeatureCardProps) {
  return (
    <motion.div
      className="flex flex-col items-center text-center"
      initial={{ y: 20, opacity: 0 }}
      whileInView={{ y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
      viewport={{ once: true }}
    >
      {/* Add the icon, title, and description here */}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Adding the Call-to-Action Section

Implement the final section with a different background color:

```tsx
<section className="w-full bg-green-50 py-12 md:py-24 lg:py-32">
  {/* Add heading, description, and button here */}
</section>
```

## Helpful Tips

- Use Tailwind's responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) for different screen sizes
- Framer Motion's `whileInView` prop is great for scroll-based animations
- The `session` prop determines which button variant to show
- Use the shadcn/ui `Button` component for consistent styling

## Committing Your Changes

When you're done with the implementation:

1. Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

2. Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add landing page implementation"
```

3. Push to your fork:

```bash
git push origin task/landing-page
```

4. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Add a brief description of what you implemented
   - Then merge it to your main branch!
